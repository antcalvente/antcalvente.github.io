Welcome to the first series about React Native journey

Important points to mention:
- Pluralsight course? 
- Expo
- Creating a bottom menu
- Using icons from Ionicons & MaterialCommunity
- Include the link: https://oblador.github.io/react-native-vector-icons/
- How to hide the system top bar: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36186385/hiding-the-status-bar-with-react-native (StatusBar.setHidden(true))
- Color Palette for the application: https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/ 

This will be another post
- How translations and i18n was achieved (translations.js)

The journey starts during one boring evening of COVID lockdown where I found myself  looking for new things to try. 

WIP
